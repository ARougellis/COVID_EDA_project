# COVID_EDA_project
In this project, I will do some exploratory data analysis on a COVID-19 dataset and visualize my findings in a Tableau dashboard.

In this project, I use SQL to query COVID-19 data to make it easier to visualize later. I split the original dataset into two in order to practice JOIN methods in SQL.

__UPDATES__: 
- EDA has been finished 
- Create temp tables and views in SQL to transfer over to Tableau
- Visualizations and dashboard in Tableau coming
